#Make Change Project

## Description

Designing  a cash register that tells the user to input the price of an item and  the cash paid by the customer for the item. 
if the cash tendered is the same ad the price of the item, then the customer gets no change. 
if the amount tendered by the customer is more than the price then customer is given a change due for the difference 

## What I learned
Learned how to ask for user input but still need to learn how to display the appropriate change due to the customer 

## Technologies Used
I made use of  Java, Eclipse, Git to help right the code.
